# svHMM

**svHMM** implements fast approximate Bayesian inference for **stochastic volatility in mean (SVM) models with heavy-tailed distributions**, using **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** approximations.

The package is designed for efficient estimation of stochastic volatility models where exact Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. It relies on C++ implementations via **Rcpp**, **RcppParallel**, and the **GNU Scientific Library (GSL)**.

## Motivation

Bayesian inference for stochastic volatility in mean models with heavy-tailed errors typically requires computationally intensive MCMC methods.  
The `svHMM` package provides a **fast and scalable alternative**, approximating latent volatility dynamics using Hidden Markov Models, enabling:

- Fast approximate posterior inference  
- Scalability to large time series  
- Robustness to heavy-tailed observations  

The methodology is based on the paper:

> **Stochastic Volatility in Mean Models with Heavy Tails:  
> A Fast Approximate Bayesian Inference Using Hidden Markov Models**
